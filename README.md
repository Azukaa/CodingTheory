# CodingTheory


# This program gives a step by step implementation of hamming code which is an error correction code that uses parity bits to detect and 
# correct bit errors that can occur when data is transmitted from one point to another. It is one of the oldest codes used in error 
# detection and correction of data.

# For this implementation, I decided to use Classes and methods to implement the operation and in order to break down every process.
